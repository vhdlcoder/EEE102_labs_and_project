These files are about VHDL and Bilkent University EEE102 class.
In my project I used DHT11, HCSR-04 and soil moisture sensor.
I used Arduino UNO for soil moisture sensor and converted analog to digital signal.
To sum up, in this project I measured the conditions of plant and compare them with ideal conditions which is inputted from user.

I hope it helps to your projects.

It says js etc. in the language section, but this project was prepared using only vhdl and a little Arduino.
